## Home Automation System Using the Facade Pattern

This code demonstrates a **Facade pattern** to simplify interaction with a home automation system, allowing the user to easily control the lights and thermostat in their home.

### 1. Subsystem Classes

The `Lights` and `Thermostat` classes represent individual devices in the home automation system. Each class provides specific functionality.

```javascript
class Lights {
    turnOn() {
        console.log('Turning on lights');
    }

    turnOff() {
        console.log('Turning off lights');
    }
}

class Thermostat {
    setTemperature(temperature) {
        console.log(`Setting temperature to ${temperature}`);
    }
}
```

- **`Lights` Class**: 
  - `turnOn()`: Turns on the lights (simulated by logging to the console).
  - `turnOff()`: Turns off the lights.

- **`Thermostat` Class**:
  - `setTemperature(temperature)`: Sets the thermostat to the given temperature.

### 2. Facade Class

The `HomeAutomationFacade` class acts as a facade, providing a simple interface to control both the lights and thermostat without requiring the user to interact with each subsystem individually.

```javascript
class HomeAutomationFacade {
    #lights;
    #thermostat;

    constructor() {
        this.#lights = new Lights();
        this.#thermostat = new Thermostat();
    }

    wakeUp() {
        this.#lights.turnOn();
        this.#thermostat.setTemperature(22);
    }

    sleep() {
        this.#lights.turnOff();
        this.#thermostat.setTemperature(18);
    }
}
```

- **Private Fields**:
  - `#lights` and `#thermostat`: Private instances of the `Lights` and `Thermostat` classes.
  
- **Constructor**:
  - Initializes the `Lights` and `Thermostat` instances and assigns them to the private fields.

- **Facade Methods**:
  - `wakeUp()`: Turns on the lights and sets the temperature to 22°C, simulating a "wake-up" setting.
  - `sleep()`: Turns off the lights and sets the temperature to 18°C, simulating a "sleep" setting.

The **Facade pattern** here hides the complexity of interacting with individual subsystems, allowing the user to control both lights and thermostat through two simple methods: `wakeUp()` and `sleep()`.

### 3. Client Code

The client code demonstrates how to use the `HomeAutomationFacade` class:

```javascript
const homeAutomation = new HomeAutomationFacade();
homeAutomation.wakeUp();
homeAutomation.sleep();
```

- **Usage**:
  - `homeAutomation.wakeUp()` calls the `wakeUp` method in the facade, which turns on the lights and sets the temperature to 22°C.
  - `homeAutomation.sleep()` calls the `sleep` method in the facade, which turns off the lights and sets the temperature to 18°C.

### Key Takeaway

The **Facade Pattern** simplifies the interaction with complex subsystems (`Lights` and `Thermostat`) by providing a unified interface (`HomeAutomationFacade`). This pattern is especially useful in situations where you want to provide a streamlined interface for multiple components, making the system easier to use and understand.
