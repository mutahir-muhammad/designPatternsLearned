## Factory Method Design Pattern in JavaScript

### What is the Factory Method Pattern?
The **Factory Method Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** used to define an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern promotes loose coupling by ensuring that the client code only interacts with an abstract interface and not with concrete implementations.

### Purpose of the Pattern:
1. To **delegate the instantiation** of specific classes to subclasses.
2. To make the code more **modular** and **extensible** for adding new types of products without modifying existing code.
3. Ideal for situations where the **exact type of object** might change based on input or configuration.

### Code Explanation

The code demonstrates the Factory Method Pattern by defining a `Transport` base class, which creates different types of vehicles (`Car`, `Bike`, and `Truck`). Here’s a breakdown of each part:

### Code Structure:

#### 1. `Vehicle` Interface (Abstract Class)
The `Vehicle` class serves as a base interface with the following methods:
- `start()`: An abstract method to be overridden by subclasses to start a vehicle.
- `drive()`: Abstract method to simulate driving.
- `refuel()`: Abstract method to simulate refueling.

The `Vehicle` class also defines `fuelType` and `maxSpeed` properties, which each subclass will specify when creating a vehicle.

```javascript
class Vehicle {
    constructor(fuelType, maxSpeed) {
        this.fuelType = fuelType;
        this.maxSpeed = maxSpeed;
    }
    
    start() { /* Abstract */ }
    drive() { /* Abstract */ }
    refuel() { /* Abstract */ }
}
```

#### 2. Concrete Vehicle Classes: `Car`, `Bike`, and `Truck`
These classes inherit from the `Vehicle` base class and implement the methods `start()`, `drive()`, and `refuel()`, providing unique behaviors for each type of vehicle.

Example: `Car` Class
```javascript
class Car extends Vehicle {
    constructor() {
        super("Petrol", 180);
    }

    start() { console.log("Starting a car..."); }
    drive() { console.log("Driving the car at max speed of", this.maxSpeed, "km/h."); }
    refuel() { console.log("Refueling the car with", this.fuelType + "."); }
}
```

Similar implementations are provided for `Bike` and `Truck`, each with unique values for `fuelType` and `maxSpeed`.

#### 3. `Transport` Class - The Factory
The `Transport` class acts as the **factory** for creating `Vehicle` objects. It has:
- An abstract method `createVehicle()`, which is overridden by subclasses to return specific vehicle instances.
- A `startTransport()` method, which utilizes the `createVehicle()` method to obtain a vehicle and then calls `start()`, `drive()`, and `refuel()` on it.

```javascript
class Transport {
    createVehicle() {
        throw new Error("Method 'createVehicle()' must be implemented.");
    }

    startTransport() {
        const vehicle = this.createVehicle();
        vehicle.start();
        vehicle.drive();
        vehicle.refuel();
    }
}
```

#### 4. Concrete Transport Classes: `CarTransport`, `BikeTransport`, and `TruckTransport`
Each subclass of `Transport` implements the `createVehicle()` method to instantiate a specific vehicle.

Example: `CarTransport` Class
```javascript
class CarTransport extends Transport {
    createVehicle() {
        return new Car();
    }
}
```

- `BikeTransport` and `TruckTransport` follow the same structure, returning instances of `Bike` and `Truck`, respectively.

#### 5. Client Code
The client code instantiates specific transport types and calls `startTransport()` on them. The factory method (`createVehicle`) creates the vehicle type, and then the vehicle’s methods are invoked.

```javascript
const carTransport = new CarTransport();
carTransport.startTransport(); // Output: "Starting a car..." "Driving the car..." "Refueling the car..."

const bikeTransport = new BikeTransport();
bikeTransport.startTransport(); // Output: "Starting a bike..." "Riding the bike..." "Refueling the bike..."

const truckTransport = new TruckTransport();
truckTransport.startTransport(); // Output: "Starting a truck..." "Driving the truck..." "Refueling the truck..."
```

### Summary
- The **Factory Method Pattern** allows the client to create objects without knowing the exact class type.
- It defines an interface (`createVehicle()` in `Transport`) and lets subclasses decide the specific type of object (`Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`) to create.
- This pattern enhances modularity, allowing new types of `Vehicle` and `Transport` classes to be added without modifying existing code.

### Advantages
1. **Flexibility** in adding new vehicle types.
2. **Encapsulation** of the instantiation logic in subclasses.
3. **Decoupling** of client code from specific vehicle types.

### Use Cases
This pattern is particularly useful in applications where you need to create instances of related classes, but you want to keep the client code agnostic to the concrete classes.
